# Web-Scraping-NBA-Stats-Sentiment-Analysis

Watching the 2022 playoffs and the amazing performances the Golden State Warriors displayed, I couldn't help to think was this their best championship season? To get answers to this question I turned to the programming language python, as I knew it had a library Request & Beautiful Soup that I can use to scrape data from the internet. I decide upon using the site Basketball-reference.com which is known to have accurate and up to date NBA stats that I will need to take on this project. I decided to limit my stats  to three key players that's been instrumental to the Golden State Warriors sucess, which are Steph Curry, Klay Thomphson, and Draymond Green. In this analysis I'm  looking to compare the two most recent championship seasons that being the 2018 & 2022 seasons, regular season and playoff included.
